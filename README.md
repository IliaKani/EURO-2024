# Animation Skills Project

This project is created to improve skills in working with animations, fonts, and frames.

## Features

- Nested file structure according to BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)
- Video insertion via iframe
- Animations via keyframes
- Countdown timer implemented in JavaScript

## Countdown Timer

The project includes a JavaScript file that implements a countdown timer. The timer calculates the time remaining until a specified end date and updates the display every second. It also includes animations for circle dots that rotate at different speeds depending on the unit of time they represent.

## Future Plans

In the future, we plan to add versions of this project for all devices to ensure a seamless user experience across different platforms.
